# **Installation Guidelines**

We will be working on a Linux based environment for ROS. If you donâ€™t have any Linux based environment setup, there are three ways to setup Linux environment and install ROS: <br>

1. [Dual Boot](https://github.com/GauravViramgami/ROS-Workshop-TL/blob/main/docs/DualBoot.md)
2. [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://github.com/GauravViramgami/ROS-Workshop-TL/blob/main/docs/WSL.md) - (Recommended)
3. [VM (Virtual Machine)](https://github.com/GauravViramgami/ROS-Workshop-TL/blob/main/docs/VM.md)

You can choose any of the one way to setup Linux Environment. If you already have any of them installed then you can directly skip to the [ROS Installation](https://github.com/GauravViramgami/ROS-Workshop-TL/blob/main/docs/ROS.md) part. However if not then the second method (Using WSL) is recommended for the workshop. 

## **Note**: The steps are taken from the following websites:
- [WSL Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- [ROS Documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- [Blog by Jack Kawell](https://jack-kawell.com/2020/06/12/ros-wsl2/)
